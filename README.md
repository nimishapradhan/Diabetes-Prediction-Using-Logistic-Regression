# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Logistic-Regression
Diabetes prediction is a machine learning project that involves predicting whether a person has diabetes based on their medical history and health metrics. This project can be beneficial for healthcare professionals and researchers to identify high-risk individuals and enable early intervention.

Logistic regression is a binary classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a binary outcome—such as whether a patient has diabetes (1) or not (0). In this project, we utilize logistic regression to build a model that takes various health indicators as input and predicts the likelihood of diabetes.

Steps Involved in Building the Diabetes Prediction Model
1️⃣ Data Collection:Use the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset, which consists of 768 women’s medical records and health indicators related to diabetes.

2️⃣ Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:Handle missing values and ensure data consistency.
Transform categorical data (if any) into numerical form.
Standardize numerical values (e.g., glucose levels, BMI) for better model performance.

3️⃣ Feature Selection:Select the most relevant features such as glucose levels, BMI, age, insulin levels, and family history (diabetes pedigree function) that strongly correlate with diabetes risk.

4️⃣ Data Splitting:Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to train the model and evaluate its performance.

5️⃣ Model Building:Train a logistic regression model using the selected features to predict diabetes probability.

6️⃣ Model Evaluation: Assess the model’s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curve.

7️⃣ Model Optimization:Tune hyperparameters and feature selection to enhance predictive accuracy.

8️⃣ Deployment: Deploy the model in a clinical or research setting to assist in early diabetes detection and monitor its performance over time.

By following these steps, we can build an accurate and reliable diabetes prediction model using logistic regression. This can help healthcare providers make data-driven decisions and improve early diagnosis and treatment strategies.
